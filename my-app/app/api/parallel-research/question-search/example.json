The part that they say they don't ask LC makes it very interesting but also leaves me with a less structured path to prepare for it. I am just not sure what to focus or brush up on. I went through posts on Glassdoor, Blind and Reddit and noticed that they ask questions related to string manipulation etc more often than not but some of those questions still used some algo knowledge (atleast) in the follow up. I read accounts of people talking about the need to use DFS and stacks in some of these questions so that threw me off a bit.\nIs there anyone who interviewed with Stripe recently and would be able to help me by provide some tips, resources or topics to read through/revise? Or if you can talk a bit about what they asked you on a high level? I am a Software Engineer with 4.5 years of experience, most of it for backend. I have been preparing for a job switch and started doing the Blind 75 list and reading through Grokking system design. As for the Stripe interview itself, I prepare to do it in Python so I was planning on going through things like best OOP practices, familiarizing myself better with all in-built functions and libraries related to things like strings, hashmaps etc and also practicing some TDD and unit testing.\n ... \n3 more replies\n\n3 more replies [More replies](/r/leetcode/comments/1d8ifef/comment/mnvxpyh/?force-legacy-sct=1)\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nRelated Answers\n\n[Stripe interview experience insights](/answers/c3d62d52-dc51-43d5-9004-ce08348dee8a/?q=Stripe%20interview%20experience%20insights&source=PDP)\n\n[Stripe SDE 2 salary insights from LeetCode](/answers/464ce82d-bc76-45b3-ae43-94ccc6b662cd/?q=Stripe%20SDE%202%20salary%20insights%20from%20LeetCode&source=PDP)\n\n[Stripe bug bash interview round details](/answers/a5b19e8a-d453-4903-84a5-be766d19053b/?q=Stripe%20bug%20bash%20interview%20round%20details&source=PDP)\n\n[Stripe online assessment for new grads](/answers/fb335c37-371d-43a7-ab80-5bd94920efe1/?q=Stripe%20online%20assessment%20for%20new%20grads&source=PDP)\n\n[Top coding interview\n ... \n# More posts you may like\n\n* [Stripe virtual onsite new graduate interview](/r/leetcode/comments/1o11q3k/stripe_virtual_onsite_new_graduate_interview/) [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/) •\n  \n  [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/)\n  \n  Discuss interview prep strategies and leetcode questions\n  \n* * *\n  \n  365K Members Online\n  \n  [### Stripe virtual onsite new graduate interview](/r/leetcode/comments/1o11q3k/stripe_virtual_onsite_new_graduate_interview/)\n  \n  5 upvotes · 4 comments\n  \n* * *\n* [Upcoming stripe interviews](/r/leetcode/comments/1nv8gkr/upcoming_stripe_interviews/) [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/) •\n  \n  [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/)\n  \n  Discuss interview prep strategies and leetcode questions\n  \n* * *\n  \n  365K Members Online\n  \n  [### Upcoming stripe\ninterviews](/r/leetcode/comments/1nv8gkr/upcoming_stripe_interviews/)\n  \n  5 upvotes · 17 comments\n  \n* * *\n* [Upcoming Stripe Interview](/r/leetcode/comments/1kcbr0k/upcoming_stripe_interview/) [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/) •\n  \n  [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/)\n  \n  Discuss interview prep strategies and leetcode questions\n  \n* * *\n  \n  365K Members Online\n  \n  [### Upcoming Stripe Interview](/r/leetcode/comments/1kcbr0k/upcoming_stripe_interview/)\n  \n  6 upvotes · 20 comments\n  \n* * *\n* \n* [SDE 1 Interview Experience](/r/leetcode/comments/1k72eao/sde_1_interview_experience/) [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/) •\n  \n  [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/)\n  \n  Discuss interview prep strategies and leetcode questions\n  \n* * *\n  \n  365K Members Online\n  \n  [### SDE 1 Interview\n ... \n](/r/leetcode/comments/1kwajn8/what_kind_of_design_questions_should_i_expect_for/)\n  \n  9 upvotes · 17 comments\n  \n* * *\n* [SRE Interview at Wells Fargo](/r/sre/comments/1c2v4iv/sre_interview_at_wells_fargo/) [r/sre](/r/sre/) •\n  \n  [r/sre](/r/sre/)\n  \n  everything site reliability engineering\n  \n* * *\n  \n  42K Members Online\n  \n  [### SRE Interview at Wells Fargo](/r/sre/comments/1c2v4iv/sre_interview_at_wells_fargo/)\n  \n  29 upvotes · 40 comments\n  \n* * *\n* [Amazon SDE 1 Interview Experience](/r/leetcode/comments/1nl7oij/amazon_sde_1_interview_experience/) [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/) •\n  \n  [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/)\n  \n  Discuss interview prep strategies and leetcode questions\n  \n* * *\n  \n  365K Members Online\n  \n  [### Amazon SDE 1 Interview\nExperience](/r/leetcode/comments/1nl7oij/amazon_sde_1_interview_experience/)\n  \n  112 upvotes · 31 comments\n  \n* * *\n* [Doing Stripe Interview in C++](/r/leetcode/comments/1gbdrop/doing_stripe_interview_in_c/) [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/) •\n  \n  [r/leetcode](/r/leetcode/)\n  \n  Discuss interview prep strategies and leetcode questions\n  \n* * *\n  \n  365K Members Online\n  \n  [### Doing Stripe Interview in C++](/r/leetcode/comments/1gbdrop/doing_stripe_interview_in_c/)\n  \n  [](/r/leetcode/comments/1gbdrop/doing_stripe_interview_in_c/)\n  \n  215 upvotes · 47 comments\n  \n* * *\n* [Rstudio brush-up for interview](/r/RStudio/comments/1d5n0vg/rstudio_brushup_for_interview/) [r/RStudio](/r/RStudio/) •\n  \n  [r/RStudio](/r/RStudio/)\n  \n  IDE for the statistical programming language R and graphics\n  \n* *"

Do you love building tools for your fellow engineers? Are you interested in infrastructure, finance, and/or entrepreneurship?\n ... \n* **Banking-as-a-Service:** Stripe allows businesses to embed financial services, such as securing business financing or card creation, directly into their own products. Each segment is supported by a talented software engineering team that not only builds and maintains Stripe’s infrastructure, but works directly with customers to make doing business a little easier. In this guide, we'll examine the Stripe software engineering interview loop, the most common interview questions, and offer some tips for success suggested by software engineers working at Stripe. Note\n\nThis guide was written with the help of an iOS Engineer at Stripe. ## What does a Stripe SWE do? []()\n\nAt Stripe, software engineering involves more than just writing code.\n ... \nFor example:\n\n* [Generate Parentheses](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/generate-parentheses)\n* [Minimum Window Substring](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/minimum-window-substring)\n* [Buy and Sell Stock](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/buy-sell-stock)\n\nThen try your hand at these sample problems:\n\n* [Find Largest Smaller BST Key](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/largest-smaller-bst-key)\n* [Shortest Cell Path](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/shortest-cell-path)\n* [Build a Basic Regex Parser](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/basic-regex-parser)\n\nHere are some common\nsample questions which match what you might get at Stripe:\n\n* [LRU Cache](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-practice/lru-cache)\n* [Course Scheduling](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/swe-practice/course-schedule)\n* [Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/)\n* [Maximize capital before IPO](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)\n\nYou can watch many more mocks in Exponent’s [Software Engineering interview course](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering) . Here are a few tips for success in coding interviews. * **Aim for a working solution first. ** Remember that Stripe cares less about efficiency than whether your solution actually works. Start with the brute force solution, explain your process, and optimize later, if you have time.\n ... \nWe work hard to understand other points of view, and prefer investigating to being right. * **Resilient. ** Startups are tumultuous places and the audacity of our goals will mean occasional failure. We view setbacks as opportunities to sharpen our skills. * **Humble. ** Stripes are humble, not arrogant or complacent, and create an inclusive environment for all. We aren’t wedded to how we currently do things—lots about our current practices will turn out to be wrong. * **Macro-optimistic. ** Stripes reject cynicism, knowing that all problems can be solved with the right understanding, and that progress is only inevitable through focused effort. We are believers in the long term. * **Exothermic.\n** Stripes generate an energy and warmth that is infectious across teams and throughout the company. We are genuinely excited about our work, and about creating an exceptionally welcoming environment for all Stripes. **How to prepare**\n\nIt can be hard to predict behavioral questions, so we recommend preparing a [story bank](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/software-engineering/swe-behavioral/swe-story-bank) to pull from. As you tweak your story bank and prep for common behavioral questions, ask yourself:\n\n* What do I do to ensure that my actions align with my team, and my company? * Why do I want to work at Stripe? What about Stripe’s vision resonates best with me? * How have I shown leadership in my past projects and personal relationships?\n ... \nAbility to effectively communicate with stakeholders is critical to your success at Stripe, so look at your interview prep as an opportunity to hone these skills.

          "Last updated: 20230126\nThe first round is the Recruiter Phone Screen, which will be an informal discussion. This will be followed by the Technical Phone Screen, which will test your System Design, Databases, Heaps, and Data Structures coding skills. The last and final round is the Onsite, which will consist of 5 interviews - Coding interview, Behavioral round, Bug Bash / Bugfixing round, System Design, and Integration Round. Note: There are various ways to apply for this role, and depending on how you do it, you might have an extra screening round(s) before the recruiter contacts you. Often in some countries' Stripe process (eg. India), when you apply online, there is a Hackerrank challenge, which is essentially a coding test. You can get both multiple-choice questions and subjective coding questions.\n ... \n##### Patreon\n\nPatreon Software Engineer\n\nInterview Guide\n\nSoftware Engineer Interview Guide\n\nJoining the software engineering team at Patreon provides an exciting opportunity for candidates to work on innovative projects and make a significant impact in the company's continued growth and success. Since the company is undergoing significant growth, it is actively expanding their team to develop Patreon v2.0 with enhanced native features. ##### Lyft\n\nLyft Software Engineer\n\nInterview Guide\n\nSoftware Engineer Interview Guide\n\nLyft is a tech company that is rapidly expanding its engineering team and looking for exceptional software engineers. ## Stripe SWE - Recruiter Phone Screen\n\n### Overview\n\nThis is an initial call with the recruiter, which would typically be an informal chat.\nYou will discuss your experiences, your background, etc. You can ask the recruiter various questions such as the different roles at the company, and what is expected of you if you join the company. The recruiter will also schedule the next round i.e., the technical screening round. ### Interview Questions\n\n* What do you know about Stripe? * What about Stripe makes you want to work here? * What are your career aspirations? * Talk about a project you’re most proud of. ## Stripe SWE - Technical Phone Screen\n\n### Overview\n\nThis will be a video call with an engineer or hiring manager from the team. It will typically be a 1-hour interview. The first 5-10 minutes are a quick intro, after which you will be required to share your screen and do live coding in the language of your choice.\nThe interviewer will typically ask only one question but will have many follow-up questions. Test cases will be provided and you will have to code the solution such that the tests pass. Depending on the time left, you may also have a chance to ask questions to your interviewer\n\nNote - The interview is designed to be of a pair-programming type, where your \"pair\" will be the interviewer. The coding questions will test the following topics -\n\n* System Design\n* Databases\n* Heaps\n* Data Structures\n\nIf you don't do well enough to pass the Stripe rubrik - you might be asked to do a follow-up 2nd round which follows a similar format\n\n### Tips\n\n* Problem statements can look complicated and unusual since Stripe nearly never asks traditional Leetcode questions.\n ... \n### Interview Questions\n\n* Print all nodes less than a given value x from the min-heap. * Given a sample database, write the unit tests to cover all cases. * Create a database class for a given problem. * Design a method to find the minimum value in a given column of the given database. * Design a function from a given database. * Design a data structure that can store a unique data type. Note - Simple questions based on if/else conditions, parsing, and arrays can also be asked. ## Practice with an Stripe Software Engineer\n\n[→ View Coach](https://prepfully.com/coaches/BXMZQJ)\n\n##### Read these articles\n\n##### Boost Your Job Interview Conversion with Mock Interviews\n\nBenefits of mock interviews are truly countless.\n ... \nIt generally consists of 5 interviews (in no particular order) which take place over a period of 3-4 hours -\n\n* Coding interview\n* Behavioral round with Hiring Manager\n* Bugbash / bugfixing round\n* System Design\n* Problem Solving / Integration Interview\n\nBefore the onsite, you will receive a preparation guide to know what to expect and what to practice for. Explore similar processes detailed in the [Visa Software Engineer](https://prepfully.com/interview-guides/visa-software-engineer) guide. **1\\. Coding interview**\n\nThis interview will test your coding skills. It's important to know Stripe doesn't ask traditional leetcode questions; they will ask questions which emulate the sort of work you'd actually be doing day to day.\nSo you might get questions which are a bit of a deviation from the standard coding DSA interviews you might have traditionally prepared for. **Sample Questions -**\n\n* How would you ensure personally identifiable information isn't accessible to people who don't need access to it within Stripe\n* Design a rate limiter from scratch. **2\\. Behavioural Round with Hiring Manager**\n\nThis will consist of leadership-oriented and behavioral-type questions. Stripe has a high bar in terms of fit, so anticipate questions which are both experiential (eg. tell me about a time) and situational (eg. how would you handle a scenario) in nature.\nStrongly recommend leveraging the STAR method to answer the questions - **S** ituation, **T** ask, **A** ction, **R** esult, and maybe adding an extra R for **R** eflection or **R** etrospective, to make sure you can demonstrate you learnt from these experiences\n\n**Sample questions -**\n\n* What is something you would have done differently in a project? * Discuss a time when you disagreed with a team decision. What did you do about it? * Talk about a time when you had to resolve a difficult situation within the team. * Tell me about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn from it? **3\\. Bug Bash / Bugfixing round**\n\nIn this round, you will be given a codebase, and you’ll have to run various tests to identify the bug(s) in the program and provide the most accurate fix."

          "Last updated: 20220522\nBeyond interview prep, this guide also helps you understand how to think like a Stripe engineer: how to write clearly, debug under pressure, and design systems that scale globally. With step-by-step preparation tips, question examples, and practical strategies, you’ll walk into your interviews feeling grounded, confident, and ready to demonstrate both technical excellence and Stripe’s signature rigor. ## Role overview & culture\n\nWorking at Stripe as a software engineer means building mission-critical systems that power a large share of global internet commerce. Engineers are expected to ship frequently and safely, often owning entire projects from initial proposal to deployment and long-term maintenance.\n ... \nBehavioral / Culture Fit Interview\n\nHere, interviewers focus on collaboration, ownership, and decision-making under ambiguity. Expect questions about how you handled production incidents, managed scope creep, or influenced technical direction without authority. Stripe engineers work cross-functionally, so interviewers want to see empathy, written communication skill, and calm reasoning under stress. **Tip:** Use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method, but emphasize reflection. End each story with what you learned or changed in your process—that self-awareness is a key differentiator. ### 4\\. Role-Specific Round (Optional)\n\nFor frontend or full-stack positions, you may have a tailored round on UI logic, API design, or performance optimization.\n ... \n* **Be transparent and professional:** Recruiters appreciate straightforward discussions around expectations and competing offers. **Tip:** After receiving your offer, ask about _equity refresh cycles_ and _promotion timelines_ . Stripe is known for rewarding consistent performance, so understanding these early helps you evaluate long-term growth. Need 1:1 guidance on your interview strategy? Interview Query’s **Coaching Program** pairs you with mentors to refine your prep and build confidence. [Explore coaching options →](https://www.interviewquery.com/coaching)\n\n## What questions are asked in a Stripe software engineer interview? In many Stripe software engineer interviews, the questions aim to surface deep problem-solving ability and clear communication under pressure.\nHere is a breakdown of what to expect. ### Coding/Technical Questions\n\nMost candidates face two technical rounds involving Stripe coding questions, covering algorithmic thinking, practical edge-case handling, and readable implementation. These may include problems related to:\n\n* Processing real-time payment streams (e.g., event ordering, failure recovery). * Writing clean, testable code that handles concurrency or stateful operations. * Debugging SQL joins, API timeouts, or race conditions. These Stripe coding interview questions often reflect Stripe’s real-world engineering challenges rather than purely academic exercises. 1.
