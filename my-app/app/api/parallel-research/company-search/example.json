Alamy\n\nListen to the article 3 min\n\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have [feedback](/contact/) .\nAcross industries, 87% of U.S. employees say reputation influenced their decision to take their current role, which was the highest of all countries surveyed, [according to an Oct. 6 report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYjytlXCkkSTKheOe8x-II3FtoL3wo4Y/view) from United Culture, a firm that specializes in company culture, employee engagement and behavioral change. Nearly half of U.S. employees said their organization’s stated values are reflected in the workplace, as compared with 31% in the UK and 27% in Germany. Across Western Europe as a whole, only 39% said they see company values lived day to day. “Reputation might open the door, but it’s the lived culture that keeps people inside,” Victoria Lewis-Stephens, managing director at United Culture, said in a statement.\n“Employees in the U.S. are looking for leaders who show they care about their wellbeing, who communicate honestly, and who act on their promises. Empty reassurances will not cut it, people want to see those values reflected in their working experiences every day.”\n\nIn a survey of 1,500 workers across the U.S., UK and Western Europe, 80% said their employer’s reputation was important during the job search. In the U.S., workers said the most effective ways that leaders can build trust include open and transparent communication (44%), as well as genuine concern for employee well-being and development (40%). Only a third of workers in France and Germany said the same, which suggests that American workers place a priority on these areas, the report found. However, consistency remains an issue.\nNearly half of U.S. workers said consequences only occur “sometimes” when company values aren’t demonstrated. About 1 in 10 said there aren’t any consequences at all. When asked what could improve their experience, U.S. workers pointed to changes in leadership behavior, communication and transparency. In fact, more than a quarter of all workers said they do their best work when leaders communicate openly, honestly and frequently, the report found. During the job search process, [a lack of transparent information can turn away candidates](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-seekers-biggest-icks/736780/) , according to a survey by StandOut CV. Respondents said they’d like to see additional details about qualifications, work hours, benefits and job titles.\nCandidate experience — especially the interview — often [has the most influence on the decision to accept a job offer](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interviews-important-candidate-experience/731197/) , according to a Gallup report. Candidates constantly evaluate a company’s culture throughout the hiring process, Gallup said, and employers can make the best impression by approaching interviews with structure, treating candidates with respect and using interviews to highlight their culture and values.\n ... \nplaybook](https://events.industrydive.com/events/2026-open-enrollment-and-total-rewards-playbook?utm_source=HR&utm_medium=Library&utm_campaign=Q42025HRDiveLive)\n\n[View all](/library/)\n\n### Company Announcements\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n[View all](/press-release/) | [Post a press release](/press-release/get-started/)\n\n### What We're Reading\n\n* CNBC [This CEO’s radical experiment has 90,000 people working without bosses: ‘I don’t have to consult with anybody’](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/great-flattening-bayer-ceo-experiment-employees-working-without-bosses.html)\n* Time [American Workers Will Pay the Price for New H-1B Visa Fees](https://time.com/7327602/trump-h1b-visa-fees/)\n* NBC4 Washington [Furloughed fed says she’s standing in Maryland food bank line after 21 years in\n ... \n## Company Announcements\n\n[View all](/press-release/) | [Post a press release](/press-release/get-started/)\n\n[Kantata Unveils the Kantata Expertise Engine™ - The First AI Platform Purpose-Built for Profes… From Kantata October 09, 2025](/press-release/20251009-kantata-unveils-the-kantata-expertise-enginetm-the-first-ai-platform-purpo/) [Tough Day Partners with The Band of Sisters to Enhance AI Workplace Advisor From Tough Day October 14, 2025](/press-release/20251014-tough-day-partners-with-the-band-of-sisters-to-enhance-ai-workplace-advisor-1/) [Personiv’s Latest Survey Report Shows Executive Leaders Doubling Down on Agility, Technology, … From Personiv October 07, 2025](/press-release/20251006-personivs-latest-survey-report-shows-executive-leaders-doubling-down-on-ag-1/) [InformedDNA"

They influence decisions, guide behaviors, and define the culture people feel the moment they walk through the door.\nBut Gallup research shows only [two in 10 employees feel strongly connected to their company’s culture](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/651980/managers-feeling-connected-organization-culture.aspx) . That’s because values only stick when they’re lived — not just written down. They need to be seen in action — modeled by leaders and reinforced through recognition. When people are recognized for living your values, those behaviors get repeated. And that’s how culture becomes real. Let’s explore what makes company core values meaningful and how to define the ones that reflect your organization best. ## 25 examples of company core values to inspire your workplace\n              \n              Company core values shape how employees show up at work — and how work shows up for them.\nThey act as a north star, guiding behavior, shaping culture, and creating a shared sense of purpose. nd when those values are reinforced through weekly recognition, employees are 9x more likely to feel a sense of belonging, according to our [State of Recognition Report](https://www.achievers.com/resources/state-recognition-report/) . That’s the chain reaction: values drive behaviors, behaviors build culture, and culture fuels business results. Looking for inspiration? Here are 25 company core values that can help shape and strengthen your workplace. ### 1\\. Integrity\n              \n              Doing the right thing — even when no one’s looking. Integrity is about staying honest, accountable, and transparent in every decision and action. ### 2\\.\n ... \nThe more tied your values are to your mission and day-to-day reality, the more likely people are to live them, not just nod at them during [onboarding](https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-onboarding/) . - **Think beyond your walls:** Your values shouldn’t just speak to employees — they should shape how customers, partners, and communities experience your brand. Values with a ripple effect are the ones that build real trust. - **Make them unmistakably yours:** If your values could be swapped onto another company’s website without anyone noticing, start over. What makes your culture tick? What do your people take pride in? Lean into that. No one’s inspired by “innovative synergy” — not even your leadership team.\n ... \n## Make company core values a part of your workplace culture\n              \n              Core values shouldn’t just live on your website or in your onboarding deck — they should show up in how people lead, collaborate, and make decisions. When values are recognized in action, they become more than statements. They become part of your [company culture](https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-culture/) . At Achievers, we know the power of living your values — because we live ours: _It’s the people, Be bold, Own the outcome, One team, Win with customers._ And through our [recognition platform](https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/) , we help organizations do the same by spotlighting the everyday moments that bring company values to life. Because what gets recognized gets repeated."

But before this epic one-day global event unfolds in all its glory, I'd like to set the tone for it today.\nOut of everything I'll be asking our esteemed guests, I'm most interested in this: Why isn't the wealth effect of higher stock prices lifting all economic and corporate ships? I'll use a few examples. Robinhood's ( [HOOD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD) ) third quarter results this week were, for lack of better terms, mind-blowing. Sales up 100%. EPS up 259%. You have to give a hat tip to co-founder and CEO [Vlad Tenev](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-robinhood-ceo-mixed-us-110006063.html) — who will be chatting with me at Invest — for driving a major reinvention of the platform. The company is pushing hard into prediction markets, banking, and cards. Mid-December will bring an \"AI Day\" for Robinhood, likely showcasing how AI may alter financial services.\nRobinhood's resurgence comes alongside stock indexes hitting record highs, ditto crypto to a lesser degree. Both of those factors have helped power Robinhood, while rival Coinbase ( [COIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN) ) has cashed in on the crypto boom. All the big Wall Street banks reported solid third quarter earnings in part because of higher stock prices feeding into the wealth management and trading businesses. But it doesn’t appear that the great boom in asset markets is lifting all households and non-financial services companies to new heights.\n ... \nJob cuts for October totaled 153,074, surging 183% from September. It was the highest level of cuts for any October since 2003. This is shaping up to be the worst year for layoffs since 2009. And it's not all because of AI ripping through back offices. The hiring at companies just isn't there! I will pretty much be wearing this same outfit for Invest this coming week. Tune in live all day! · Yahoo Finance\n\nThe economy and corporate America are at this strange intersection. Enter Invest.

It can be tiring work. But looking at a collection of mission statements across a variety of industries can teach us a lot about creating purposeful companies.\nWhether you’re the CEO of your own company or a business leader, the art of writing a purposeful mission statement is a valuable skill. I was so curious about mission statements I collated 51 mission statement examples from the world’s most successful companies. I hope this is useful for others exploring this subject. If you find this post useful please consider adding to the [leaving a comment -below]() already on this page or sharing this post with others. My short book “ A Simple Guide To Sketchnoting: How To Use Visual Thinking to Improve Communication & Problem Solving ” is [available now on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3CSDQXF) .\n ... \nEducation, Community and the Environment.”\n\n“To discover, develop and commercialize therapeutics that advance patient care, while challenging employees to make a difference and building a thriving worldwide enterprise.”\n\n“To create shareholder and societal value while reducing the environmental footprint along the value chains in which we operate.”\n\n“We will provide branded products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers.”\n\n### Receive Regular Updates\n\nDirect updates to your email inbox.No spam. Opt-out anytime.\nSubscribe\n\n## Humanitarian Mission Statement Examples\n\n“The maintenance of international peace and security.”\n\n“To prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.”\n\n“To follow our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in working with the poor and oppressed to promote human transformation, seek justice and bear witness to the good news of the Kingdom of God.”\n\n“Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation, which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and to force the solutions which are essential to a green and peaceful future.”\n\n“To help people worldwide where the need is greatest, delivering emergency medical aid to people affected by conflict, epidemics,\n ... \nWill the mission statement INSPIRE your key stakeholders — employees, managers, customers, suppliers, others to want to join and adopt your mission\n   \n   Collectively, the 51 missions you documented do all that, but most fall short of communicating all those elements that make for a more complete mission statement. For example, Walmart’s mission is very inspiring, easy to read and comprehend and simply and effectively communicates the value it strives to create for its customers and how it expects to accomplish that goal. It is missing references to other stakeholders such as its employees as being key to delivering on that mission. Walmart not only creates value for consumers, but also traing and creating jobs for its many employees and creating value for the communities it servess.\n ... \nIt’s hard to say why one company’s mission statement is more customer oriented than another. In Amazon’s case, I know only what I’ve read about the company, but I’ve always been impressed how their leader writes an ‘annual letter to shareholders’ and how building a customer-oriented culture is at the heart of these letters and the business. If we look at the mission statement, this clearly reflects the value the company places on customers. Other companies, in contrast, may focus on product, the network they run, or even engineering ingenuity. This is one of the great things about mission statements – they often tell us not only how the company will compete, but what’s important to its culture and purpose. I hope this helps! Good luck with your presentation.

If you have a body, you are an athlete.”  \n    I like these mission statements the best because they tell a lot about the company and are specific. They are not too long but give you a good grasp of what the companies are all about and what they do. [Reply]()\n34.\n ... \nVision statements describe the “what”, the desired future state whereas a mission statement describes the “how”. The best example of both is from Cisco “Shape the future of the Internet (the vision, the “what”) by creating unprecedented value and opportunity for our customers, employees, investors, and ecosystem partners. (the mission, the “how”)”.

So glad this info was useful to your for you leadership session. I agree with you that many of these examples merge mission and vision statements."

These tips can help employees and leaders build toward developing a rewarding experience for all. Share\n\n[Blog](https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/category/blog/)\n\nNov 28, 2023 | Last updated on Feb 24, 2025\n\n9 minute read\n\nOn this page\n\nIt’s estimated that the average adult living in the United States will spend 90,000 hours — or one-third of their lives — at work. That’s a lot of time, so it’s important for people to choose jobs that they enjoy.\n ... \nPositive workplace culture is an offshoot of [positive psychology](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2021/04/23/culture-is-a-companys-single-most-powerful-advantage-heres-why/?sh=631533a7679e) , an evidence-based branch of psychology focused on the character strengths and behaviors that lead to living a life of meaning and purpose. People’s behaviors at work are shaped by the organization’s collective beliefs and values. Applying the research supporting positive psychology to the workplace showcases the characteristics and behaviors that lead to individual workers flourishing. When people across the business flourish, the company does better as a whole and employees are happy.\n ... \n[Learn more about The Positive Workplace: Building Employee Engagement and Satisfaction](https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/programs/workplace-engagement/)\n\n## **How to Identify a Company with a Positive Workplace Cultur** e\n\nIt can be hard for people to identify companies with positive workplace cultures, especially since the interview process can be relatively short and human resources teams and hiring managers are likely to paint a rosy picture of the company. Here are a few tips to help identify companies that truly offer healthy work environments versus those that may _say_ they do, but actually don’t in practice. ### Do your research\n\nWhen researching information about a company before the interview, pay attention to factors that could point to a negative culture.\nLook for information on employee turnover or employee retention. Companies with a high turnover rate often have a poor working environment, causing people to leave. If people tend to stay, they are more likely to be happy and fulfilled, which indicates a positive culture. LinkedIn is a great research tool to learn more about a company’s culture. Search for current and past employees. If they are in your network or you have a connection, ask to contact them to have a candid discussion about what the culture is really like. Look at company reviews on sites like Glassdoor, but keep in mind that people are inspired to leave complaints more than they are willing to leave positive reviews. Follow the company’s social media channels."
